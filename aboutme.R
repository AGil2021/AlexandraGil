  > ### My Background
  > 
  > I am a second year MPH student, my concentration is in Biostatistics. 
  I always think that the knowledge of the data will give you decision power, 
  that the main reason that I decided to come back to school after so many years. 
  I am originally from Colombia, I got my bachelor degree as a Food Engineer back in 2011.
  I decided to move to the Unites States in 2015 and just until 2020 in the middle of the 
  COVID-19 Pandemic I started this journey. It amazing how you can find data about so 
  many topics and you can transforme the data to create big impact over the entire population.
  
  ### Experience
  I work at Gwinnett Health Department as a Health Inspector, 
  I have been working as a part of the COVID-19 response team, 
  during the last year and halft. My goal is be fully involved in the data analysis
  for infectious diseases.
  
  ### Course Goals
  Througth this MPH journey I have been using STATA, SAS and R. I have some personal preference ,
  however, I really enjoy the facts that you can find tons of good resourses about R just using Google. Making
  our life a little be easy. With MADA I have so many exceptations, such as:
    - Improve my data analysis, specifically in infectious diseases.
    - Get familiar with clean data 
    - Process data in R to get usable outcomes
    - Learn about machine learning
  
  ### Hobbies and Fun Facts
  - Deep sea fishing has been a familiar activity that started as a curiosity and now is 
    part of our summers.
    
  - As my first language is Spanish I really enjoy doing activities to improve my English 
    proficiency such as, listen podcast or reading.
